# Set up a MetalLB Load Balancer on a on-premises Kubernetes Cluster

Without MetalLB or any similar software solution the External IP of any new created service in Kubernetes will stay indefinitely in pending state. MetalLBâ€™s purpose is to cover this deficit by offering a network load balancer implementation that integrates with standard network equipment, so that external services on bare-metal clusters work in a similar way as their equivalents in IaaS platform providers.

# Installation
The installation of MetalLB is easy we are going to perform it by applying the necessary manifests (everything will be provisioned in a new namespace named metallb-system)
