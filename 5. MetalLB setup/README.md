# Set up a MetalLB Load Balancer on a on-premises Kubernetes Cluster

Without MetalLB or any similar software solution the External IP of any new created service in Kubernetes will stay indefinitely in pending state. MetalLBâ€™s purpose is to cover this deficit by offering a network load balancer implementation that integrates with standard network equipment, so that external services on bare-metal clusters work in a similar way as their equivalents in IaaS platform providers.

# Example Try:

```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx-server --image=nginx
kubectl expose deployment nginx-server --type LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
```
# output

# Installation
The installation of MetalLB is easy we are going to perform it by applying the necessary manifests (everything will be provisioned in a new namespace named metallb-system)


```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.13.7/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml
```
we need to provide the components required by MetalLB. The next manifest will deploy MetalLB to the cluster, in metallb-system namespace we just created. The components are:

```sh
1. the metallb-system/controller deployment. A cluster-wide controller that handles IP assignments.
2. the metallb-system/speaker which is a daemonset. That is the component to make the services reachable.
3. the service accounts for the controller and speaker, along with the RBAC permissions that the components require.
```
